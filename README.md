# Emo Detect

## Emotion Detection project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV:

In this project, I implemented a robust Emotion Detection system using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV. The goal was to accurately identify and classify facial expressions in real-time video streams. Leveraging a deep learning model trained on a kaggle dataset  (either you csn download the data set or you cab directly use the kaggle kernel and load the data set ) of facial expressions, the CNN efficiently detected key facial features associated with various emotions.

link for the data set : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

accuracy of the given trained model : 70%

The project involved preprocessing facial images using OpenCV to extract relevant features, and the trained CNN was then employed to analyze these features and predict the emotional state of the individuals. The integration of OpenCV facilitated real-time face detection and allowed for seamless implementation in live video feeds or recorded footage.

The Emotion Detection system demonstrated high accuracy in recognizing 7 different type of emotions 'Angry','Disgust','Fear','Happy','Neutral', 'Sad', 'Surprise' .

This project not only showcased the power of deep learning in emotion recognition but also highlighted the practical application of computer vision techniques for real-world scenarios, such as human-computer interaction.
